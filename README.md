# Introduction
In Android, we will use the adb and fastboot tools very much, so I summarized to use them effectively.

# Abstract
## ADB
Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps, and it provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device. It is a client-server program that includes three components:

- `A client`, which sends commands. The client runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client from a command-line terminal by issuing an adb command.

- `A daemon (adbd)`, which runs commands on a device. The daemon runs as a background process on each device.

- `A server`, which manages communication between the client and the daemon. The server runs as a background process on your development machine.

## Repo
Repo is a tool built on top of Git. Repo helps manage many Git repositories, does the uploads to revision control systems, and automates parts of the development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git. The repo command is an executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path.
